# Car Classification Using ResNet-50

This project focuses on fine-grained car classification using the Stanford Cars dataset. We applied transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained **ResNet-50** model to classify images into 196 different car makes and models. The system includes data preprocessing, model training using PyTorch, and deployment as a web application for real-time predictions.

## Key Features
- Fine-tuned ResNet-50 on Stanford Cars dataset
- Image preprocessing and augmentation for improved generalization
- High-accuracy classification across 196 car classes
- Real-time web-based prediction system
- Built using PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe, ReactJS, and Node.js

## Responsibilities
- Researched the architecture and transfer learning capabilities of ResNet-50  
- Lead developer responsible for core implementation, including data preprocessing, augmentation, and model training in PyTorch  
- Downloaded, organized, and labeled the Stanford Cars dataset  
- Divided tasks and coordinated team workflow to ensure smooth project execution  
- Built and deployed a web interface for users to upload car images and receive classification results in real time
